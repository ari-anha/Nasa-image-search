# Nasa Image Search App

The actual app has been deployed here:[link to app].

## The brief

The aim was to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space.

The app had to include:

- A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
- Images must be returned upon a successful search

The NASA API endpoint for image search was provided:
GET​​ ​​https://images-api.nasa.gov/search ​Params: ​​q

A Nasa worm logo asset was provided, if I wished to use it:

There was no specific rules on the styling, but it would be taken into consideration.

## Acknowledgement

This app was built using React. The design is fully responsive to adapt to different screen sizes, and the colour-palette was chosen to make the app more friendly to colour-blind users.

Testing utilities used:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

Packages used:

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)
- [React Icons Library](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

## How to run the app

Clone the repo onto your machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ari-anha/React-tech-test
```

Change directories so that you are in the cloned repository.

```
$ cd React-tech-test
```

Install npm.

```
$ npm i
```

Start npm.

```
$ npm start
```

The app should pop up onto your browser.

## If I had more time...

### "About" page

I would have a separate page that explains in a bit more detail what the app is about.

### Image details

Each image will be clickable. Once you click, it would take you to another page, where the original size of the image and its details will be shown.
