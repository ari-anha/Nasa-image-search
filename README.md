# Nasa Image Search App

The actual app has been deployed here:[link to app].

## The brief

The aim was to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space.

The app had to include:

- A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
- Images must be returned upon a successful search

The NASA API endpoint for image search was provided:
GET​​ ​​https://images-api.nasa.gov/search ​Params: ​​q

A Nasa worm logo asset was provided, if I wished to use it:

There was no specific rules on the styling, but it would be taken into consideration.

### "About" page.

What the app is about.
