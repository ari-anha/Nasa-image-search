# Nasa Image Search App

The actual app has been deployed here:[link to app].

## The brief

The aim was to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space.

The app had to include:

- A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
- Images must be returned upon a successful search

The NASA API endpoint for image search was provided:
GET​​ ​​https://images-api.nasa.gov/search ​Params: ​​q

A Nasa worm logo asset was provided, if I wished to use it:

There was no specific rules on the styling, but it would be taken into consideration.

## How to run the app

Clone the repo onto your machine.
`$ git clone https://github.com/ari-anha/React-tech-test`

Change directories so that you are in the cloned repository.
`$ cd React-tech-test`

Install npm.
`$ npm i`

Start npm.
`$ npm start`

The app should pop up onto your browser.

## If I had more time...

### "About" page.

I would have a separate page that explains in a bit more detail what the app is about.

### Image details

Each image will be clickable. Once you click, it would take you to another page, where the original size of the image and its details will be shown.
